This project is work on next basked recommendation engine built on Kaggle Instacart Data. We built 3 models - LGBM and TBP and Naive Bayes. The working codes for them are LGBM_final, TBP_final, naive_bayes_model. 

For TBP, we have two versions - 2.X , 3.X , each are the variations and experiments, TBP_final is best code for all the versions

For LGBM, we have LGBM final, which is base implementation of LGBM. gbm_mod is a modified experimentation done on clusters of users.

LGBM user specific is mix of LGBM model and TBP model. We have combined both features and added them.
